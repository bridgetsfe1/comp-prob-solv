# Difference in Isothermal and Adiabatic Work
The main difference in isothermal and adiabatic work processes are that isothermal is done at a constant temeprature and adiabatic is done at a changing temperature such that there is no heat exchange between the system and its surroundings. For the same volume change, it is seen that the work done in the isothermal process is more negative, thus more work is being done over the same change in volume. This makes sense because as the system expands work had to be done by moving heat in/out of the system to maintain a constant temperature.
