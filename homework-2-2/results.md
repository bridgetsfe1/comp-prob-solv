# Behavior of B_2V comparison and Shape of Potential
The behavior exhibited by the hard sphere potential seems to be a constant second virial coefficient over any temperature. This is different from both the square well and lennard jones potentials, which have a varying second virial coefficient. This makes sense because a hard sphere potential remains constant and is either 0 or infinite depedning on the distance, r.

The square well and lennard jones potentials follow a similar curve when graphing the second virial coefficient versus time starting negative and becoming positive at higher temperatures. They both vary over temperature because V(r) for both of these potentials has a region where it is finite and non-zero, thus over time the second virial coefficient changes over temperature.
