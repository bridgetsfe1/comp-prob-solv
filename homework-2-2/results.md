# Behavior of B_2V comparison
The behavior exhibited by the hard sphere potential seems to be a constant second virial coefficient over time. This is different from both the square well and lennard jones potentials, which have a varying second virial coefficient over time. This makes sense because a hard sphere potential remains constant as distance increase and only varies if distance if smaller than r, thus making the value infinite. 
The square well and lennard jones potentials follow a similar curve when graphing the second virial coefficient versus time.
